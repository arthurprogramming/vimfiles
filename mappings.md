 it)

  pattern. In this case we delete lines that don’t match what we’re looking for.

  matches a pattern.  example :g/def/normal Ai -> will insert at the end of each line containing the
  def word a 'i' to


# Matching Patterns and literals
- `\v` ... enables very magic search, means that in the pattern after it all ASCII characters except
  '0'-'9', 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z' and '_' have a special meaning.
- `\V` ... cancel special meanings of words for pattern matching (e.g. `., *, }, ...`) -> this kind
  of search is called verbatim searches, example: `/\Va.k.a` will match only `a.k.a` and no
  `backward`
- `\x` ... is a shortcut for the pattern `[0-9A-Fa-f]` -> you can learn more about them under `:h
  character-classes`
- use parentheses to match pattern and use them later with reference: example `/\v<(\w+)\_s+\1>`
  with `\1` we are referencing to the first match
- searching with word boundaries: you can use `<` for the beginning and `>` for the end
  - `/\<word\>` ... matching only the word which stands alone with <word> - no other words in front or after the word
  - `/<word\>` ... matching only words which ends on <word>
  - `/\<word\>` ... matching only words which starts with <word>


# Hacks
- replace line ending through **\\\\:** `:%s/$/ \\\\/`
- replace **a = b** to **b = a:** `:%s/\(.*\)=\(.*\)/\2=\1`
