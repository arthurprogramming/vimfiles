 it)
  - compile your tex-document normally
  - start the `\ls` mode
  - where the cursor is, this place will be displayed in the .dvi file
- `inverse (reverse) search`
  - `<C-Left>` left mouse click in the .dvi file this location will be opend in the source file

# Help

- `:helpgrep <searchterm>` ... search all doc after the specified term (press :cwindow to see all matchings)
- `:help ins-completion` overview of commands to start autocompletion
- `:help 'complete'` ... specifies how keyword completion works
- `:help :vglobal` ... shows us how to perform an operation on all lines that don’t match the given
  pattern. In this case we delete lines that don’t match what we’re looking for.
- `:help :global` ... is how we can run a given command (in this case a :normal command) for each line that
  matches a pattern.  example :g/def/normal Ai -> will insert at the end of each line containing the
  def word a 'i' to


# Hacks
- replace line ending through **\\\\:** `:%s/$/ \\\\/`
- replace **a = b** to **b = a:** `:%s/\(.*\)=\(.*\)/\2=\1`
