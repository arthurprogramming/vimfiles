# Vim settings

I'm always eager to learn, but I can't remember everything. Here is the list of the plugins I'm using - it is a reminder
of the most important commands and settings for each plugin.


# Installation

Do not copy my *.vimrc* because they may not fit to your working style (see **Luca Pettes**
[wonderful article](http://lucapette.com/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration)). But if you
would like to use this repository run the `install.sh` script.
