# Usage

I highly not recommend you to copy my *.vimrc* because they may not fit to your working style (see **Luca Pettes**
[article](http://lucapette.com/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration)). But if you would like to use this
repository to get started with Vim, please perform the following tasks:

- `mv <path-to-vim-settings-clone>` ~/
- `mkdir ~/.vim/.backup`
- `mkdir ~/.vim/bundle`
- Start Vim and type `:BundleInstall`
