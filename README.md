## Installation

I highly not recommend you to copy my *.vimrc* because they may not fit to your working style (see **Luca Pettes**
[wonderful article](http://lucapette.com/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration)). But if you
would like to use this repository to get started with Vim, please perform the following tasks:


- `git clone --recursive git@github.com:matthias-guenther/vim-settings.git ~/.vim`
- `mkdir ~/.vim/backup`
- `mv ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/`
